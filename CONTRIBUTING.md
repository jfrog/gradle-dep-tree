- If the existing tests do not already cover your changes, please add tests.
- Pull requests should be created on the _main_ branch.

# ‚öíÔ∏è Building and Testing the Sources

## Build Gradle Dependency Tree

Clone the sources and CD to the root directory of the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/jfrog/gradle-dep-tree.git
cd gradle-dep-tree
```

Build the sources as follows:

On Unix based systems run:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

On Windows run:

```
gradlew.bat clean build
```

Once completed, you'll find the gradle-dep-tree-<version>.jar at the build/libs/ directory.

## Tests

To run the tests, run the following command:

On Unix based systems run:

```
./gradlew clean check
```

On Windows run:

```
gradlew.bat clean check
```

# üêû Debug

To debug the gradle-dep-tree process, follow these steps:
1) Create a new debug configuration in your IDE. Choose "Remote JVM Debug" and ensure the following fields are correctly configured:
   * Debugger Mode: Attach to remote JVM
   * Host: localhost
   * Post: 5005
   * Use module classpath: <no module>
2) Search for the point in your code that triggers the gradle-dep-tree process.
3) Add the following flags to the command: "-Dorg.gradle.debug=true", "--no-daemon"
4) When you execute the command with the added flags, the program will freeze. At this point, you can navigate to the gradle-dep-tree code, set a breakpoint, and run the debug configuration in "Debug" mode.
   This will allow you to resume your original execution inside the gradle-dep-tree code.
5) Upon exiting the gradle-dep-tree code, the execution of your code before entering the gradle-dep-tree process will be resumed.
